Install java-environment 
========================

Install Ant:
------------
Before you can build the java-environment, you have to install the Ant build tool 
(see http://ant.apache.org).


Using Ant to build java-environment:
------------------------------------
After installing Ant, you can build and install the java-environment with a single call:

  # Build and install lib/*.jar and doc/*.pdf to the ../ccmtools directory (by default):
  $ ant install	


Additionally, you can use the following ant variants:

  # Clean up the project directory	
  $ ant clean:   

  # Run a uml2idl test: 	
  $ ant test

  # Generate javaDoc:
  $ ant doc		

  # If you want to use the java-environment without the ccmtools, you can define
  # another install path:
  $ ant install -Dprefix=<install-path>


Update your CLASSPATH:
----------------------
To use the java-environment tools, you have to add the *.jar files installed
in the <install-path>/lib directory to your CLASSPATH:

  $ export CLASSPATH=<install-path>/lib/antlr.java:       \
                     <install-path>/lib/uml2idl.jar:      \
                     <install-path>/lib/mdr01.jar:        \
	             $CLASSPATH
