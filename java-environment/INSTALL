Install java-environment 
========================

Install Ant:
------------
Before you can build the java-environment, you have to install the Ant build tool 
(see http://ant.apache.org).


Using Ant to build java-environment:
------------------------------------
After installing Ant, you can build the java-environment with a single call:

  # Build dtd2java and uml2idl	
  $ ant

Additionally, you can use the following ant variants:

  # Clean up the project directory	
  $ ant clean   

  # Run a uml2idl test 	
  $ ant test

  # Generate javaDoc
  $ ant doc		


Update your CLASSPATH:
----------------------
To use the java-environment tools, you have to add the *.jar files created or
hosted in the java-environment/lib directory to your CLASSPATH:

  $ export CLASSPATH=<java-environment-path>/lib/antlr.java:     \
	             <java-environment-path>/lib/dtd2java.java:  \
                     <java-environment-path>/lib/uml2idl.jar:    \
	             $CLASSPATH
