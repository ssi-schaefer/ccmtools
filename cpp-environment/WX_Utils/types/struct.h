   \brief A map of name/value pairs
   
   \ingroup utils_types

   It works about as a Python dictionary in that the keys are strings
   and the values can be of arbitrary type (as long as the base type
   is a Value). The difference between a Python dictionary and a
   Struct is that a copy of a Python dictionary is in fact only a copy
   of the reference to the dictionary (which means that modifications
   are visible by everyone else who own a copy of the same
   dictionary). A copy of a Struct is a real copy, however, so it is
   safe to make modifications without disturbing others.

   As a side note, copying a Struct is fairly cheap because it is
   internally implemented as copy-on-write.

   \todo Performance: Inline a bit. Check how std::hash_map (?) works.

       Unlike string comparison, however, Struct comparison is more
       difficult and less obvious; it works as follows (let x, y be
       Struct instances). First, if x has less (more) items (members,
       keys) than y, then x is less (greater) than y. Next, if both
       have an equal number of keys, the lists of the keys of x and y
       are compared lexicographically. (These lists are lists of
       strings, where the strings are compared as defined in the C++
       standard.) Next, if both x and y have equal keys, the
       associated values are compared using their comparison
       methods. Note that this is the point where type mismatches can
       occur; you cannot compare an integer value with a string value,
       for example, let alone an integer value with a struct value. In
       such cases an exception will be thrown. */
