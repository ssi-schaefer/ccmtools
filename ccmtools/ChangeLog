----------------------------------------------------------------------------
*) removed cpp-environment/wx
*) moved cpp-environment/wx/measurement to cpp-environment/ccm/utils/measurement
*) removed bin/ccmtools-generate 
*) added etc/logging.properties file to support Java's logging API
*) moved ccmtools.UI.ConsoleCodeGenerator to ccmtools.UI.Main
*) refactored UI.Main (removed all System.exit() and added some String Constants)
*) bugfix: CppRemoteGeneratorImpl.java converter for remote exception

     - uml2idl has been implemented as a Shell script
     - ccmtools-idl is already implemented in Python

*) added support of receptacle attributes


RELEASE-0.5.1-pre5
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
*) removed CORBA_Stubs namespace from generated IDL2 and remote C++ files

*) bugfix: *_entry.h files in impl/ must be overwritten by every generator
