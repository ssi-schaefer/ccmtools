Latest stable release : CCM Tools 0.3.2 "Hog Heaven"

   The CCM Tools have once again reached a stable state in development !
   After a lot of hard work and conceptual development, the development
   team is proud to announce the newest toolset for generating CORBA
   components and support code.

   Please note that this release, though more functional and stable than
   any previous release to date, is still a development release. Fully
   functional production releases of the CCM Tools will require
   additional bug fixing and development effort, but don't let that stop
   you from trying out the tools.

   The new release includes many feature enhancements from the 0.2 stable
   branch, and includes several significant bugfixes. This release
   specifically addresses the following issues :
     * The IDL parser, IDL code generators, and C++ code generators can
       handle complex namespaces. Components and homes can access
       interfaces defined in arbitrary namespaces (but a component and
       its home must always be defined in the same namespace). The IDL
       parser currently lacks support for more obscure namespace features
       like typeid and scope aliasing, but support will be added soon.
     * Several additional test cases have revealed and allowed us to fix
       some complex bugs in the C++ generators. Remote C++ generator
       support will follow in the 0.3.3 release !
     * Generated test clients and application logic files follow a
       simpler file structure that allows for generating, building, and
       compiling C++ components with a single Confix call. Homes for C++
       components have been isolated with a single code entry point (see
       the generated CCM_Local_*_CCM_Session_*_share/ directories), and
       application logic is now generated in the src/ directory.
     * User types files have been completely removed, allowing for a much
       more elegant component structure, at the cost of more restricted
       implementation choices.
