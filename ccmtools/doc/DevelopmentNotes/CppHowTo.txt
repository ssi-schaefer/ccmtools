C Pre-Processor (CPP)
=====================

The OMG specified that an IDL parser has to support a C pre-processor functionality.
Currently, the ccmtools use the GNU cpp tool.

There is a ccmtools.parser.cpp package that encapsulates the cpp access by using a
PreProcessor interface and different implementations. If the ccmtools.cpp property
is set in the etc/ccmtools.property file, this external cpp is used. In the other way
the internal implementation has to process the input files.

ExpernalCpp: delegates to an external pre-processor configured in the 
	etc/ccmtools.property file.
	
InternalCpp: implements a minimal cpp functionality in Java to be independent of
	GNU's cpp tool (e.g. when generating Java components an a Windows platform).	
	Currently, there is no working InternalCpp implementation - only experimental 
	code!!!
