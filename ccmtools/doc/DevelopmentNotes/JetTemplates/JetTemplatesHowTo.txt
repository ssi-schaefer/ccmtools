Java Emitter Templates (JET)
============================

The JET engine (a tool that compiles the *.jet template files into *.java 
source files) is part of the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) PlugIn. 
Thus, we can only generate Java template classes from *.jet files by using the 
Eclipse platform (or significant parts of it).

Therefore, all generated template classes are also checked in 
(e.g. ccmtools.generator.java.templates).

Eclipse Settings:    
-----------------
To use the Jet engine for the ccmtools project, we have to configure the eclipse
project properties:

Menu Project => Properties => Jet Settings:
    
    Template Containers: src/ccmtools/generator/java/templates/jet;src/ccmtools/generator/idl/templates/jet
    
    Source Container   : src
