IDL3 Subset Supported by the CCM Tools Framework
================================================

The CCM Tools framework don't support the whole IDL3 specification. Thus, we define an
IDL3 subset which is used by all CCM Tools generators.

specification as an IDL3 reference):

		- Bounded String
		- Boundet Sequence
		- Fixed Type
		- Native Type
		- 64bit Types (long long, unsigned long long, long double)
		- Anonymous Types (already deprecated)
		- "abstract" Interface
		- "local" Interface
		- Nested Type- and Exception Definitions within Interfaces
			Components and Homes
		- "oneway" Operations
		- Operation "context" Expressions
		- Union
		- Value Declaration
		- Event Declaration
		- Component Event Ports ("emits", "publishes", "consumes")
