IDL3 Subset Supported by the CCM Tools Framework
================================================

The CCM Tools framework don't support the whole IDL3 specification. Thus, we define an
IDL3 subset which is used by all CCM Tools generators.

Following IDL3 constructs are (currently) not supported by the CCM Tools (see the IDL3
specification as an IDL3 reference): 

		! "readonly" Attributes 
		! Attribute Exceptions (getraise, setraise)
		! Component (single) Inheritance
		! Home (singe) Interitance

		- 64bit Types (long long, unsigned long long, long double)
		- Bounded String
		- Boundet Sequence
		- Fixed Type
		- Union
		- Native Type
		- Value Declaration
		- Event Declaration
		- Anonymous Types (already deprecated)
		- "abstract" Interface
		- "local" Interface
		- Nested Type- and Exception Definitions within Interfaces
			Components and Homes
		- "oneway" Operations
		- Operation "context" Expressions
		- Component Event Ports ("emits", "publishes", "consumes")
		- Primary Key Specification for Homes
		- Finder Methods for Homes
		- Supported Interfaces for Homes
		- Import Declaration
		- Repository Identity Declaration
		- Repository Identifier Prefix Declaration
