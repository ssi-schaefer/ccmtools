As a quick tour through component--based software development using CCM Tools,
we implement a simple component that provides single interface to its clients.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

        \includegraphics [height=5cm,angle=0] {figures/LoginComponentExample}
        \caption{ A simple component example.}
        \label{figure:SimpleComponentExample}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

You will see how to define a simple component
(Fig.~\ref{figure:SimpleComponentExample}) in the CCM Tool's Interface
Definition Language (IDL) and how to use CCM Tools to generate code
in different programming languages.

The following sections are structured in form of CCM Tools use cases. Each use
case describes a usage scenario for a particular set of CCM Tools features. 
At the end of a use case, you will have a running component example.

This chapter contains a lot of CCM Tools stuff which will be described very
brief, never mind, you can find more exhaustive 	explanations in the related
manual chapters.
