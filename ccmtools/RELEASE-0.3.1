Latest stable release : CCM Tools 0.2.1 "Benadryl"

   The CCM Tools are now new and improved with a first bugfix release,
   version 0.2.1 ! This release fixes several bugs from the 0.2.0 "From
   Scratch" release, including the following :

     * Forward declarations are handled properly.
     * The nasty hack of global "user types" header files has been
       replaced with a proper solution.
     * The Metamodel library includes more accurate information about
       source IDL files.
     * The parser properly supports include paths for IDL files.

   See the [1]CCM Tools description for more details about this package,
   and [2]read our papers for more information on CBSE and the CCM.

   The 0.2.1 release will likely be the last release in the 0.2 series ;
   we think it is stable enough to build and play with basic components.
   Keep in mind, though, that this release series is still lacking two
   important features :

     * Remote (out-of-process) components are not fully implemented.
     * The Python component wrappers are full of memory leaks.

Latest unstable release : CCM Tools 0.3.1

   The unstable release series provides the two features mentioned above,
   in a nice alpha form that's just perfect for testing--please do !
   Check out the [3]unstable release series for downloads, or look at
   our [4]SourceForge file releases.

Dependencies

   The CCM Tools depend on [6]Java (>= 1.4) and [7]Python (>= 2.1) to
   run.

   Generated C++ component code relies on [8]Confix (>= 1.1) for
   building and installation.

   The Python wrapper generator depends on the Python interpreter (>=
   2.1) header files and development libraries, along with the
   [9]Boost.Python (>= 1.29) headers and libraries.
