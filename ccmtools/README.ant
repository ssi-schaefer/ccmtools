----------

Ant is a Java-based build tool (http://ant.apache.org)

We are going to use ant (parallel to the autotools) to build the ccmtools. 

1st step: we use ant to build the uml2idl generator tool
   $ ant        # build the dtd2java.jar and uml2idl.jar file in the lib directory
   $ ant clean  # deletes all temp files that are generated while building the 
                # dtd2java.jar and uml2idl.jar files.

   see the build.xml file to get an idea how ant do this...
