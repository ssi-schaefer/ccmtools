Latest stable release : CCM Tools 0.2.2 ""

This release fixes several bugs from the 0.2.1 "Benadryl" release, 
including the following :

    * The IDL parser now handles arrays accurately.
    * IDL arrays are mapped to C++ std::vector.
    * The generated test-client does not call methods on supported,
      provided or used interfaces on its own.
      It only instantiates the component and its mirror component 
      and connects the ports. All test cases must be implemented in
      the mirror component's business logic.
      This solves the test-value problem with user defined data types.
    * There are some new test-cases (see test/idl/README) that check the 
      implementations of IDL parser and code generators.
