Latest stable release : CCM Tools 0.2.0 "From Scratch"

   The CCM Tools have made a first public release, version 0.2.0! Please
   check our [1]SourceForge files page for download information, or just
   go to the [2]current releases to download.

   The CCM Tools are CASE tools designed to generate the structural code
   necessary for component-based software projects. Generated components
   adhere to the CORBA component model. Currently implemented generators
   produce C++ code suitable for local (in-process) components, automatic
   test components ("mirror components"), and IDL versions 2 and 3. See
   the [3]CCM Tools description for more details about this package, and
   [4]read our papers for more information on CBSE and the CCM.

   Keep in mind that, although this is a stable release, the CCM Tools
   are still alpha software. This means that, while the tools are
   unlikely to set your computer on fire, full functionality is still
   lacking. Notably missing at the moment are two features :

     * Remote (out-of-process) components are not implemented. Thus only
       in-process components can be generated. Still, we think this is
       pretty fun to play with, especially with the mirror test
       components.

     * The Python component wrappers are still in heavy development. When
       Python wrappers are more functional, component testers will be
       able to test almost all component facets and receptacles using a
       set of Python scripts. This allows for more rapid debugging since
       it eliminates the need for the recompilation cycle and prevents
       some segmentation fault errors (they become exceptions
       instead ...).

   Both of these features are under development in the [5]unstable
   release series. Check them out, but beware unstable software !

Latest unstable release : CCM Tools 0.3.0

   The unstable release series basically just serves as a CVS snapshot at
   this point. Check out the [5]unstable release series periodically for
   downloads.

Dependencies

   The CCM Tools depend on [6]Java (>= 1.4) and [7]Python (>= 2.1) to
   run.

   Generated C++ component code relies on [8]Confix (>= 1.1) for
   building and installation. The Python interpreter (>= 2.1) header
   files and development libraries, along with the [9]Boost.Python (>=
   1.29) headers and libraries, must be available to use the embedded
   Python wrappers.
