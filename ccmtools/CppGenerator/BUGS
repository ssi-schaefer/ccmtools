+ Components will only be implemented properly if they have exactly one
  associated home.

+ Events are not supported at all. This means the following IDL declarations
  will be ignored :
  o emits
  o publishes
  o consumes
  o eventport
  o event

+ Value box and value member are not supported.

+ Unions are currently not generated properly, though they should be shortly.
