This directory has the following content:

mdr01.jar   A subset of the Netbeans Metadata Repository (http://mdr.netbeans.org).
            It generates Java code out of MOF metamodels using the Java Metadata
            Interface (JMI). We use this tool for the OCL metamodel.

oclmetamodel.jar   The OCL metamodel.
                   It is used by the DbC (design by contract) generator.

MOF/OCL.*   The MOF metamodel and the generated sources for OCL.


You must add mdr01.jar and oclmetamodel.jar to the Java classpath!
