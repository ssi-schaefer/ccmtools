This directory contains the results of the performance tests
for 'design by contract' components.

All performance tests return results for the local component
and for the DbC-component. If you want to measure only the
overhead of DbC-components without the test of the constraints,
do the following:
1) rename the OCL-file, so the parser will not find it
2) create new code -> you will get a DbC-component without constraints
3) run the test and use the output from the DbC-test
4) rename the OCL-file to it's original name
