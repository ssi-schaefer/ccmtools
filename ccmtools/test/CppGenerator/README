Using Remote Components
======================= 

To use the remote components a CORBA NameService must be started: 

> nsd -ORBIIOPAddr inet:localhost:5050 -ORBIIOPVersion 1.2 

Note that the host (localhost) and the port (5050) can change between 
different platforms.
Mico provides a tool to browse the running NameService:

> nsadmin -ORBInitRef NameService=corbaloc:iiop:1.2@localhost:5050/NameService

The remote test generator creates a _check_*_remote.cc file that
can be used as a unit test for remote components. To run these tests,
the following environment variable must be set:

> export CCM_NAME_SERVICE=corbaloc:iiop:1.2@localhost:5050/NameService
