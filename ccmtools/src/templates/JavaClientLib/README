Java Emitter Templates (JET)
----------------------------

The JET engine (a tool that compiles the *.jet template files into *.java 
source files) is part of the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) PlugIn. 
Thus, we can only generate Java template classes from *.jet files by using the 
Eclipse platform (or significant parts of it).

Therefore, all generated template classes are also checked in 
(see ccmtools.JavaClientLib.templates).

Jet settings in the ccmtools project (Properties/Jet Settings):
    Template Containers: src/templates/JavaClientLib
    Source Container   : src
